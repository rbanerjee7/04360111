Overall we have 4 folders:

........Data Processing.......... 
This folder has two files used to describe Section III ('Data Preperation') of our report.

Data_processing.ipynb : This file is used to process the input data from "Forecasting FTSE100_index" and convert it to 'Processed data'. The "Forecasting FTSE100_index" contain data from 9th Sep 2011 till 1st Match 2024.

Feature_importance : This file is used to measure the feature importance of different features.



........Classical..........
This folder has files discussing Section Section IV('Classical Approach') of our report. The 'Processed data' contain data from 9th Sep 2011 till 1st Match 2024.

Classical_solutions(train and test error).ipynb : This file contains classical solution for LSTM, ARIMA, Standard ANN and XGBoost.

Proposed_ANN(train and test error).ipynb : This file contains proposed ANN approach training and test error. The data used for training and testing is same as used by Classical_solutions(train and test error).ipynb.

Proposed_ANN_prediction(March prediction): This file is to anaylze the performance of proposed-ann predictions

LSTM_prediction(March prediction): This file is to anaylze the performance of LSTM prediction



.........quantum_method.........

This folder has files discussing Section V('Quantum approach') of our report.
The data used is from Aug 2013 till 1st March 2024.

Classical_LSTM_Quantum_compare.ipynb: This file contain classical solution for LSTM.

Proposed_ANN_Quantum_compare : This file contain classical solution for proposed ANN.

Qlstm_DRC: This file contain quantum solution for Quantum LSTM using DRC.

Qlstm_NO-DRC: This file contain quantum solution for Quantum LSTM using NO-DRC.

QNN: This file contain quantum solution for proposed Quantum Neural Network.

Comparison_plot: This file contains comparison plot between classical and quantum
